## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CUBE

### What I learned

- The CUBE helps you plan out the CSS build but you still need to think about naming
- The the <tbody>for tables isn't always needed, depending on what the table looks like/contains
- That table borders need to be collapsed before you apply any styling - otherwise they can cause issues

### Continued development

I was surprised at how much I'd forgotten about tables and styling them! Makes me consider that I shouldn't bypass the more simple challenges as they will have bits in them that I haven't touched in a while and the knowledge refresh will be of use.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_table_collapse) - This showed me how table collapse-borders works.
