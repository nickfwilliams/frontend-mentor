## My process

For this project, I started with the mobile design and then moved onto the desktop version utilising grid. I found this presented some chllanges with heights and the page sizing transition from desktop to mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this project I learned that it's often best to have a grid within a container div, not make the container div the grid also. By not separating the two I gave myself a few headaches with height isses and I feel that I could've made the solution more elegant had I gone down the route of body > container > grid-layout.

Despite the above, I did use previous learning to insert some extra columns and used these as left and right responsive margins.

I was particularly happy with realising I could use scale/translate to stagger the reviews rather than relying on margin.

### Continued development

Mpre grid practice required - I was surprised at how niggly this project was, especially as it's a newbie one.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-fr-unit) - I used this site for help with underdtanding grid size units.
- [Example resource 2](https://techstacker.com/how-to-prevent-image-stretching-with-flexbox/#:~:text=Fortunately%2C%20the%20solution%20is%20simple,middle%20of%20its%20parent%20container.) - This provided me with the solution to stopping the star images sretching as a flex item.
