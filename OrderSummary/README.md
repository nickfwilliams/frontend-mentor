## My process

- For this first project, I chose something simple that I felt was within reach of my ability. I started with the HTML before writing any CSS and when I did start the CSS, I started from the top down (hero image). This helped me to break the page up and focus on one thing at a time. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a great project to help me focus on the basics and shake some rust off. For example, font sizing - I used the Kevin Powell tip of setting the font-size in the HTML as 62.5% in order to help me with the rem calculations (see below). I learned the difference between em and rem measurements and how the cascade affects them.

```css
 html {
      box-sizing: border-box;
      font-size: 62.5%;
    }
```

### Continued development

During the course of this project, I discovered that I'm not very familair with box shadows and their various elements. I also need to put some work into my Flexbox understanding as there were a few times when the outcome I got wasn't the one I expected!

### Useful resources

- [KP - em vs rem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) - This helped me to better understand the difference between em and rem and which one to use in different situations.
- [KP - Are you using the right CSS units?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To) - This helped me to better understand the difference between em and rem and which one to use in different situations.
- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide is really helpful with all things Flexbox. This helped me to understand the difference between parent and child elements.
